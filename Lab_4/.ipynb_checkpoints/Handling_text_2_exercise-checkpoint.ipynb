    "The Sheldon Cooper we all know and love (OK, some of us might not know him, and some might not love him) from the TV series \"The Big Bang Theory\" has gotten into an argument with Leonard from the same TV show. Sheldon insists that he knows the show better than anyone, and keeps making various claims about the show, which neither of them know how to prove or disprove. The two of them have reached out to you ladies and gentlemen, as data scientists, to help them. You will be given the full script of the series, with information on the episode, the scene, the person saying each dialogue line, and the dialogue lines themselves.\n",

If you've done this correctly, you should have a list of 20 names. However, one of these is clearly not a recurrent character. Manually remove that one, and print out your list of recurrent characters.

Leonard contests this claim, since he believes that this claimed accuracy is too high.

Each of your data points (which is one row of your matrix) is one **dialogue line**. Now, use the scikit-learn class **TfIdfVectorizer** to create TF-IDF representations for the data points in your training and test sets. Note that since you're going to train a machine learning model, everything used in the training needs to be independent of the test set. As a preprocessing step, remove stopwords and words that appear only once from your vocabulary. Use the simple tokenizer provided in `helpers/helper_functions.py` as an input to the TfidfVectorizer class, and use the words provided in `helpers/stopwords.txt` as your stopwords."
